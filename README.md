# Refurbished_Devices-Regression_Testing
Analysis of used device data using linear regression to identify which factors contribute the most to pricing

### Project Description:

The used device data will be analyzed and used to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a used phone/tablet and identify factors that significantly influence it.

### Skills:

Linear Regression, Linear Regression assumptions, R-squared values, RMSE (root mean square deviation), MAE (mean absolute error), MAPE (mean absolute percentage error), QQ Plots, Shapiro-Wilk test of Normality, Goldfeldquandt test for heteroscedasticity, Exploratory Data Analysis (Variable Identification, Univariate analysis, Bi-Variate analysis), Python

## This project contains 2 files:

Full notebook (Refurbished_devices_project_FULL_NOTEBOOK.ipynb)

> This notebook contains the entirety of the project including all of the code to perform a run-down of the data/datatypes, exploratory data analysis, and all insights and observations.

Key Insights (Refurbished_devices_project_KEY_INSIGHTS.ipynb)

> This notebook contains only some important visualizations, results, and insights (less of the scratchwork).

### Libraries used:

sklearn, statsmodels, pylab, scipy, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
